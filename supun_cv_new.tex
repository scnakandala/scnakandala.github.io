\section{Research Interests}
My research interest lies broadly in the intersection of Systems and Machine Learning, an emerging area which is increasingly referred to as \textit{Systems for ML}. In this space I operate as a data management researcher.
Taking inspirations from classical data management techniques, I build new abstractions, algorithms, and systems to improve efficiency, scalability, and usability of machine learning workloads. I am also interested in large-scale applied ML, which opens new systems challenges.

\section{Ongoing Projects}
\par

\textbf{Project: \textsc{Medical Data to Knowledge}} \hfill Started September 2018\\
In this joint project between UCSD CS department and UCSD Medical School, I develop new deep learning-based techniques for predicting human activity (e.g., sitting, standing, and stepping) from accelerometer data. The data is collected from a large cohort of patients who wore accelerometer devices for seven days of free living. The goal is to develop accurate methods to predict human activity from these accelerometer data and then use them in downstream human activity and metabolic health correlation analysis. The challenges of this project include working with large volumes of training data (1 TB) and performing extensive \textit{model selection} such as neural architecture search and hyperparameter tuning.


\textbf{Project: \textsc{Cerebro}} \hfill Started September 2018\\
Deep neural networks are revolutionizing many ML applications.
But there is a major bottleneck to wider adoption: the pain of \textit{model selection}.
This empirical process involves exploring the deep net architecture and hyper-parameters, often requiring hundreds of trials.
Alas, most ML systems focus on training one model at a time, reducing throughput and raising costs; some also sacrifice reproducibility.
We are developing {Cerebro}, which is a system to raise deep net model selection throughput at scale and ensure reproducibility.
\textsc{Cerebro} uses a novel parallel execution strategy we call \textit{model hopper parallelism} which is inspired by the multi-query optimization technique.
Experiments on \textit{Criteo} and \textit{ImageNet} datasets show \textsc{Cerebro} offers up to 10X speedups and improves resource efficiency significantly compared to existing systems like Parameter Server, Horovod, and task-parallel tools.
