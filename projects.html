                                        Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) are revolutionizing many machine
                                        learning (ML) applications. But training ANNs is a notoriously painful
                                        empirical process, since accuracy is tied to the ANN architecture and
                                        hyper-parameter settings. The common practice to choose these settings
                                        is to empirically compare as many training configurations as feasible
                                        for the application. This process is called model selection and it is
                                        a major bottleneck for adoption of ANNs.

                                        In this project, we propose a new system for ANN model selection that
                                        raises model selection throughput without raising resource costs. We have
                                        4 key system desiderata: scalability, statistical convergence
                                        efficiency, reproducibility, and system generality. To satisfy all these
                                        desiderata, we propose a novel parallel execution strategy we call model
                                        hopper parallelism (MOP).

                                        In the past few years several optimized systems have been developed for accelerating deep
                                        learning prediction serving. However, in many domains, classical ML methods are still widely
                                        used. In this project we try to answer the following question: <em>Can we represent classical
                                        ML pipelines using tensor computations to reuse deep net prediction serving systems for
                                        classical ML prediction serving?</em>
                                        <br/>
                                        <br/>
                                        To realize this goal, project Hummingbird takes inspiration from query
                                        processing/optimization techniques in RDBMSs and compiles classical ML pipelines into
                                        tensor computations. Experiments on real-world use cases show that Hummingbird enables
                                        significant speedups (even up to 10X)  and seamless hardware acceleration for classical
                                        ML prediction serving compared to other existing systems.

                                        Deep CNNs are now the preferred way to perform image analytics in many
                                        domains including healthcare, e-commerce, security, and sociology.
                                        However one of the main criticisms pointed against deep CNNs is the
                                        black box nature of how they make predictions. To explain CNN
                                        predictions one of the widely used approaches is the occlusion based
                                        explanation approach (OBE).
                                        However, OBE experiments are highly time consuming as they need to
                                        perform large number of re-inference requests.

                                        In this project we apply incremental and approximate inference
                                        optimizations to accelerate the OBE workload.
                                        Our work is inspired by the long line of work in incremental view
                                        maintenance, multi-query optimization, and approximate query processing
                                        techniques in the context of relational data management systems.

                                        Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have revolutionized computer
                                        vision, achieving near-human accuracy on many prediction tasks. This has
                                        led to a growing interest in using deep CNNs to exploit images, video,
                                        and other unstructured data sources for analytics in many applications.
                                        However, there are still numerous practical bottlenecks in using deep
                                        CNNs for data analytics.
